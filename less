# Like -r, but only ANSI “color” escape sequences are output in "raw" form
export LESS=" -R "
# To enable line number
export LESS=" -N "

# To disable the terminal refresh when exiting
less -X

# To save the contents to a file
# Method 1 - Only works when the input is a pipe
s <filename>

# Method 2 - This should work whether input is a pipe or an ordinary file.
Type g or < (g or less-than) | $ (pipe then dollar) then cat > <filename> and Enter.
# vim: set ft=sh
